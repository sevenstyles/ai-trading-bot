Volatility-Confirmed Dual Timeframe Breakout Strategy
======================================================

CORE ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:
--------------------------
1. High Timeframe Structure Analysis:
   - Identify Consolidation Phases:
       * Look for extended periods (3+ candles) on HTF charts with narrow range movement (e.g. â‰¤2.0% range).
       * Mark turning points when the price is testing key support/resistance levels.
   - Detect Breakouts:
       * Confirm a valid breakout when the price closes outside the consolidation range with a significant move.
       * Look for a substantial increase in volume during breakout candles as confirmation of directional bias.
   - Note Trend Shifts:
       * Use the breakup of previously established levels (such as strong highs or lows) to indicate change of market character.

2. Lower Timeframe Entry Timing:
   - Micro Breakout and Fakeout Detection:
       * On LTF charts, look for oscillations or micro "fakeout" patterns following a breakout.
       * Confirm entry when a candle closes decisively in the breakout direction and is supported by a relative volume surge.
   - Dual Timeframe Confirmation:
       * Align the high timeframe breakout signal with corresponding micro-level confirmation for precise trade entry.

3. Volume Confirmation:
   - Validate Breakout Strength:
       * Ensure that identified breakout moves are accompanied by a clear spike in volume relative to the preceding candles.
       * Use volume clustering on both high and lower timeframes to filter out weak or false moves.

RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL:
--------------------------
- Stop Loss (SL):
   * Place SL just beyond the consolidation zone (recent high for long setups and recent low for short setups) plus an ATR-based buffer.
- Take Profit (TP):
   * Set TP at the next identified resistance (in bearish trades) or support (in bullish trades), ensuring a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:3.
- Adjust Position Sizing:
   * Make sure the SL level is acceptable relative to the trade's risk and the overall ATR-based volatility.

ENTRY & REJECTION CRITERIA:
---------------------------
1. Mandatory Setup Conditions:
   - Evidence of a clear consolidation phase on the higher timeframe.
   - A valid breakout is confirmed with a strong close and accompanying volume surge.
   - Lower timeframe (15-minute) charts display a congruent micro-level breakout pattern that avoids false "fakeout" signals.
   - Dual timeframe alignment is present with both trend direction and timing cues.

2. Reject Trade If:
   - The price remains in consolidation or there is no clear breakout.
   - Volume is insufficient or the breakout candle is weak.
   - Lower timeframe signals conflict with the established high timeframe direction.
   - External or volatile news conditions distort the technical patterns.
