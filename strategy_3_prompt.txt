Supply & Demand Liquidity Strategy Framework
======================================================

CORE COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Zone Formation:
   - Supply: Push down creating supply zone
   - Demand: Push up creating demand zone
   - Maximum zone age: 48 hours
   - Zone drawing rules:
     a) Normal: Full candle if wick doesn't exceed next candle
     b) Accuracy: Body + top/bottom wick only if wick exceeds next candle

2. Liquidity Formation:
   - Small retracement not tapping zone
   - Must break previous high/low that created liquidity
   - Multiple liquidity sweeps add confluence

3. Zone Validation:
   - Must be untapped zones only
   - No candle closures inside zone
   - Must align with higher timeframe trend
   - Zones near trend extremes preferred over middle zones

ENTRY RULES:
---------------------------
Primary Entry Methods:

1. Candle Close Entry:
   - First candle close in intended direction after zone tap
   - Valid if tapping candle closes in direction

2. Break of Candle Entry (Secondary):
   - Only on strong momentum moves
   - Before bullish/bearish close
   - When trying not to miss entry
   - Use with caution, only 10% of setups

3. Flip Entry (Rare):
   - When candle flips direction in final minutes
   - Must show strong momentum flip
   - Only valid if initial tap respected zone

RISK MANAGEMENT:
----------------------
Stop Loss Rules:

1. Normal Stops:
   - Below/above entry wick
   - Must provide minimum 1:3 RR
   - Account for retest room

2. Maximum Stop Size:
   - 1% maximum for majors (BTC, ETH)
   - 2% maximum for altcoins
   - Only on extreme rejection wicks
   - Must still meet RR requirements

Take Profit Strategy:

1. TP1 (Mandatory):
   - Minimum 1:3 risk reward
   - Target nearest swing high/low
   - Take partial position off (50%)

2. TP2 (Extended):
   - 1.618 Fibonacci extension
   - Previous major highs/lows
   - Maximum 1:10 risk reward
   - Full position target

Break Even Rules:
   - Only move stop to BE after TP1 hit
   - Exception: During high impact news/events
   - Give trade room to breathe/retest

TREND ALIGNMENT:
----------------------
1. Higher Timeframe:
   - Check 4H/1H for trend direction
   - Identify major support/resistance
   - Look for retracement completion zones

2. Local Structure:
   - Higher highs / higher lows for uptrend
   - Lower lows / lower highs for downtrend
   - Clean price action required

1. Zone Related:
   - Candle closes inside zone
   - Zone already tapped
   - Against major HTF levels
   - Middle zone without strong momentum

2. Technical Related:
