1. Swing Point Identification:

   - The algorithm identifies swing highs and lows.
   - A swing low is a point where the market makes a
     significant low, followed by a move higher.

   Example:

        High          High
         /\            /\
        /  \          /  \
       /    \        /    \
      /      \      /      \
     /        \    /        \
    /          \  /          \
   Low         Low          Low (Swing Low)

2. Parsed Low:

   - The code uses a concept called "parsed low".
   - Normally, parsed_low = low of the candle.
   - In high volatility candles, parsed_low = high of the candle.

3. Order Block Identification (Bullish):

   - Find a Swing Low.
   - Find the *previous* Swing High.
   - Between the previous Swing High and the current Swing Low:
     Find the lowest Parsed Low.  This forms the Order Block.

   Example:

        High (Previous Swing High)
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \   <- Search for lowest Parsed Low in this region
     /        \
    /          \
   Low           Low (Swing Low)
                  |
                  +-----+
                  |  OB |  <- Order Block (Lowest Parsed Low)
                  +-----+

4. Mitigation
    - A bullish order block is considered 'mitigated' if the price subsequently drops below the order block's low.

   Example:

        High (Previous Swing High)
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \   <- Search for lowest Parsed Low in this region
     /        \
    /          \
   Low           Low (Swing Low)
                  |
                  +-----+
                  |  OB |  <- Order Block (Lowest Parsed Low)
                  +-----+
                     \
                      \
                       \  <- Price moves below OB low = Mitigated
                        \
