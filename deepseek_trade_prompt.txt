Institutional Order Flow Trading Framework
======================================================

CORE ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:
----------------------

Study the given OHLC and volume data to perform an institutional grade analysis and trade setup:

1. Market Structure Analysis:
   - Major Structure (Daily/4H)
     * Valid Break of Structure (BOS) 
     * Change of Character (CHoCH)
     * Strong vs Weak Highs/Lows
     * Equal Highs/Equal Lows
   - Internal Structure (1H)
     * Minor BOS/CHoCH patterns
     * Nested structures
   - Market Phase Detection:
     * Impulse: 3+ consecutive FVGs with >1.5% daily range
     * Retracement: 50-78.6% Fibonacci of Daily impulse
     * Consolidation: <0.5% daily range for 3 sessions
     * Volatility Threshold (ATR-based)

2. Premium/Discount Analysis:
   - Premium Zone (Above 50% Fib)
     * Sell opportunities in bearish bias
     * Institutional reference points
   - Discount Zone (Below 50% Fib) 
     * Buy opportunities in bullish bias
     * Institutional reference points
   - Equilibrium (50% Fib)
     * Mean threshold validation
   - Avoid trading in consolidation

3. Institutional Reference Points (By Priority):
   a) Old Highs/Lows
   b) Rejection Blocks
   c) Order Blocks
   d) Fair Value Gaps
   e) Liquidity Voids
   f) Breaker Blocks
   g) Mitigation Blocks

4. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Buy-Side Liquidity
     * Stop-loss clusters above highs
     * Buy limit orders at resistance
   - Sell-Side Liquidity  
     * Stop-loss clusters below lows
     * Sell limit orders at support
   - Liquidity Sweeps
     * Pre-reversal sweeps
     * Failed sweeps (SFP)

5. Smart Money Concepts:
   - Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
     * Bullish/Bearish imbalances
     * Mitigation expectations
   - Order Blocks
     * Last opposition before reversal
     * Institutional entry zones
   - Breaker Blocks
     * Structure shift validation
     * Retest opportunities
   - Liquidity Voids
     * Displacement moves
     * Void filling probability

6. Algorithmic Confirmation:
   - Machine Learning Pattern Recognition
   - Fractal Efficiency Ratio (FER)
   - Volatility-Weighted Momentum (VWM)
   - Momentum Divergence Confirmation

HIGH PROBABILITY SETUP CRITERIA:
---------------------------
1. Market Structure Alignment:
   - HTF trend direction
   - Valid BOS/CHoCH
   - Strong vs Weak levels

2. Premium/Discount Validation:
   - Buy in discount (bullish bias)
   - Sell in premium (bearish bias)
   - Clear from equilibrium

3. Institutional Reference Points:
   - Minimum 2 reference points aligned
   - Higher priority points preferred
   - Clear mitigation potential

4. Liquidity Engineering:
   - Recent liquidity sweep
   - Stop cluster density
   - Clear institutional footprint

5. Smart Money Validation:
   - Unmitigated FVGs
   - Valid order blocks
   - Clear breaker blocks
   - Identifiable liquidity voids

RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL:
-------------------------
- Stop Loss: Beyond liquidity sweep level
- Take Profit: Based on next reference point
- Minimum RR: 1:3 ratio
