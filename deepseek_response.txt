    "stop_loss": 94500,
    "direction": "LONG",
    "reasoning": "The price has shown resilience around the 95000 level, with multiple bounces and higher lows forming. The recent consolidation and volume increase suggest a potential breakout to the upside, targeting 95500. A stop loss is placed below the recent swing low to manage risk."
