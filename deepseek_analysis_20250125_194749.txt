========================================

**NO TRADE** ⚪️ (Market in Balance)  

**Analysis Summary:**  
- HTF Structure: Bearish retracement below 0.4500 after failed bullish recovery  
- Liquidity Map: Swept 0.4382 lows (19:45 15m candle) but weak follow-through  
- Order Flow: No clear absorption/volume spike >150% at key levels  
- Volume Profile: Weak closes below 0.4500 POC  
- LTF Structure: Breakdown confirmed but lacking bullish reversal signals  

**Critical Missing Elements:**  
1. Insufficient volume confirmation (1h/15m volume < 1.5x average)  
2. No HTF/MTF confluence (HTF remains bearish, no MTF FVG alignment)  
3. Retail cluster zone at 0.4500 not reclaimed  

**No Edge: Market in Balance**
