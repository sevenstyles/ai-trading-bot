Institutional Order Flow Trading Framework
======================================================

CORE ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:
----------------------

Study the given OHLC and volume data to perform an institutional grade analysis and trade setup:

1. Market Structure Analysis:
   - Major Structure (Daily/4H)
     * Valid Break of Structure (BOS) 
     * Change of Character (CHoCH)
     * Strong vs Weak Highs/Lows
     * Equal Highs/Equal Lows
   - Internal Structure (1H)
     * Minor BOS/CHoCH patterns
     * Nested structures
   - Market Phase Detection:
     * Impulse: 3+ consecutive strong closes with >1.5% daily range
     * Retracement: 50-78.6% Fibonacci of Daily impulse
     * Consolidation: <0.5% daily range for 3 sessions (mark but don't trade)
     * Volatility Threshold (ATR-based)

2. Premium/Discount Analysis:
   - Premium Zone (Above 50% Fib)
     * Sell opportunities in bearish bias
     * Institutional reference points
   - Discount Zone (Below 50% Fib) 
     * Buy opportunities in bullish bias
     * Institutional reference points
   - Equilibrium (50% Fib)
     * Mean threshold validation
   - Avoid trading in consolidation
   - Validate with recent liquidity sweep direction
   - Confirm zone alignment with bigger timeframe FVG

3. Institutional Reference Points (By Priority):
   a) Old Highs/Lows
   b) Rejection Blocks
   c) Order Blocks
   d) Inverse Fair Value Gaps (Post-Sweep)
   e) Fair Value Gaps
   f) Liquidity Voids
   g) Breaker Blocks
   h) Mitigation Blocks
   i) Structural Change Points

4. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Buy-Side Liquidity
     * Stop-loss clusters above highs
     * Buy limit orders at resistance
   - Sell-Side Liquidity  
     * Stop-loss clusters below lows
     * Sell limit orders at support
   - Liquidity Sweeps
     * Pre-reversal sweeps
     * Failed sweeps (SFP)

5. Smart Money Concepts:
   - Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
     * Bullish/Bearish imbalances
     * Mitigation expectations
   - Order Blocks
     * Last opposition before reversal
     * Institutional entry zones
   - Breaker Blocks
     * Structure shift validation
     * Retest opportunities
   - Liquidity Voids
     * Displacement moves
     * Void filling probability
   - Inverse FVG Patterns:
     * Must follow liquidity sweep
     * Should show displacement through inefficiency
     * Validate with structural change confirmation
   - SMT Confirmation:
     * Smart Money Trap confirmation
     * Volume-weighted price rejection at key levels

6. Algorithmic Confirmation:
   - Machine Learning Pattern Recognition
   - Fractal Efficiency Ratio (FER)
   - Volatility-Weighted Momentum (VWM)
   - Momentum Divergence Confirmation

HIGH PROBABILITY SETUP CRITERIA:
---------------------------
1. Market Structure Alignment:
   - HTF trend direction
   - Valid BOS/CHoCH
   - Strong vs Weak levels
   - Recent liquidity sweep confirmation
   - Inverse FVG present in entry zone

2. Premium/Discount Validation:
   - Buy in discount (bullish bias)
   - Sell in premium (bearish bias)
   - Clear from equilibrium

3. Institutional Reference Points:
   - Minimum 2 reference points aligned
   - Higher priority points preferred
   - Clear mitigation potential

4. Liquidity Engineering:
   - Recent liquidity sweep
   - Stop cluster density
   - Clear institutional footprint
   - Validate opposing liquidity target:
     * Minimum 2 equal highs/lows
     * Internal pool within 1:3 RR ratio

5. Smart Money Validation:
   - Unmitigated FVGs
   - Valid order blocks
   - Clear breaker blocks
   - Identifiable liquidity voids

7. "Forever Model" Validation:
   - A++ Setup Requirements:
     * Triple timeframe alignment (Daily/4H/1H)
     * Confluence of 3+ reference points
     * Volatility contraction pattern

RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL:
-------------------------
- Stop Loss: Beyond liquidity sweep level
- Take Profit: Based on next reference point
- Minimum RR: 1:3 ratio (measured from entry to TP vs entry to SL)
- Validate SL placement:
  * Beyond recent high/low cluster + 0.5Ã—ATR buffer


EXAMPLE ANALYSIS FORMAT:
---------------------------
Analysis:
- Market Structure: [Bullish/Bearish/Consolidation]
- Premium/Discount: [Zone + Reference Points]
- Liquidity Status: [Recent Sweeps/Clusters]
- Smart Money Setup: [Key Reference Points]
- 'Forever Model': [Sweep + Inverse FVG + Structural Change]
- Entry Trigger: [Specific Condition]
- Stop Loss: [Beyond Key Level]
- Take Profit: [Target Reference Point]
- RR Ratio: [1:x.x]

FILTERING CONDITION CONSIDERATIONS:
----------------------------
1. Reject if <3/5 confidence score
2. Avoid counter-trend without HTF alignment
3. Require minimum 2 reference points
4. Reject consolidation setups
5. Wait for clear liquidity sweeps
6. Confirm premium/discount zones
7. Validate market structure
8. Require smart money confirmation
9. Reject trades without inverse FVG pattern
10. Require recent structural change confirmation

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
-----------------------
- Output price levels as numbers only (e.g. 61250.50)
- Include all reference points used
- Specify premium/discount zones
