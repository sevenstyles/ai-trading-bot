Forever Model Trading Framework
======================================================

CORE COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation:
   - Clear buy/sell side liquidity sweep
   - Must occur before inverse FVG formation
   - Validate with volume spike (>2x average)

2. Inverse Fair Value Gap (FVG):
   - Must form AFTER liquidity sweep
   - Displacement through inefficiency zone
   - Minimum 3-candle formation
   - Validate with 0.5×ATR penetration

3. Structural Change Confirmation:
   - Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Break of Structure (BOS)
   - Series of 3+ closing candles against trend
   - Validate with momentum shift (RSI crossover)

4. Smart Money Trap (SMT) [Optional A++]:
   - Price rejection at key level (>2% wick)
   - Volume-weighted rejection pattern
   - Confluence with HTF order block

5. Opposing Liquidity Target:
   - Minimum 2 equal highs/lows
   - Internal pool within 1:3 RR ratio
   - Validate with cluster of 3+ liquidity markers

SETUP CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED):
---------------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep Sequence:
   - HTF liquidity pool identification
   - Sweep of recent high/low with weak close
   - Subsequent pullback into manipulation zone

2. Inverse FVG Formation:
   - Must displace through inefficiency
   - Formed in direction of intended trade
   - Unmitigated FVG from previous move

3. Structural Change:
   - Close below/above 3 consecutive trend candles
   - Momentum confirmation (MACD/RSI divergence)
   - Volume increase on structural break (>1.8x)

4. Liquidity Alignment:
   - Clear opposing liquidity pool
   - Minimum 1:3 risk-reward ratio
   - No intervening liquidity between entry-TP

ENTRY TRIGGERS:
----------------------
1. Primary Entry:
   - Retest of inverse FVG zone
   - Price reaction at 50% retracement
   - Confluence with HTF pivot level

2. Secondary Entry:
   - Break of swing high/low post-FVG
   - Close beyond 0.25×ATR from trigger candle
   - Volume confirmation on breakout

RISK MANAGEMENT:
----------------------
- Stop Loss: 
   * Beyond liquidity sweep extreme + 0.3×ATR
   * Maximum 1.5% account risk
   
- Take Profit:
   * Full: Opposing liquidity zone

- RR Ratio: Minimum 1:3 (measured entry-SL vs entry-TP)

CONFIRMATION FILTERS:
----------------------
1. Reject if:
   - No clear HTF liquidity target
   - FVG forms before liquidity sweep
   - Structural change lacks volume confirmation
   - Price consolidates >3 candles post-trigger

2. Accept only:
   - Confluence with HTF order block
   - Momentum aligns with trade direction
   - Clean sweep of liquidity (no double tops/bottoms)


IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
-----------------------
- Output price levels as numbers only (e.g. 61250.50)
