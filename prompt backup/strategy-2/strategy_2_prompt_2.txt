Forever Model Trading Framework
======================================================

CORE COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation:
   - Clear buy/sell side liquidity sweep
   - Must occur before inverse FVG formation
   - Volume spike validation (2.5-3x average for high volatility assets)
   - Maximum sweep formation time (3 candles)
   - Multiple sweep validation adds strength

2. Inverse Fair Value Gap (FVG):
   - Must form AFTER liquidity sweep
   - Displacement through inefficiency zone
   - Minimum size 1.2% of current price
   - Maximum age 48 hours
   - Multiple FVG confluence adds strength
   - Validate with dynamic ATR penetration

3. Structural Change Confirmation:
   - Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Break of Structure (BOS)
   - Volume-weighted price levels
   - Maximum 12 candles for validation
   - RSI threshold >65 for bullish, <35 for bearish
   - Volume progression during formation

4. Smart Money Trap (SMT) [Optional A++]:
   - Price rejection at key level (2.5-3% wick)
   - Volume-weighted rejection pattern
   - Multiple timeframe trap alignment
   - Confluence with HTF order block
   - Volume distribution analysis during trap

5. Opposing Liquidity Target:
   - Minimum 2 equal highs/lows
   - Internal pool within 1:3 RR ratio
   - Validate with cluster of 3+ liquidity markers
   - Volume-weighted price levels

SETUP CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED):
---------------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep Sequence:
   - HTF liquidity pool identification
   - Sweep of recent high/low with weak close
   - Subsequent pullback into manipulation zone
   - Progressive volume increase
   - Multiple timeframe alignment

2. Inverse FVG Formation:
   - Must displace through inefficiency
   - Formed in direction of intended trade
   - Unmitigated FVG from previous move
   - Minimum size requirement met
   - Age requirement met

3. Structural Change:
   - Volume-weighted price levels broken
   - Momentum confirmation (MACD/RSI thresholds)
   - Volume increase on structural break (>1.8x)
   - Time-based validation window
   - Multiple timeframe alignment

4. Liquidity Alignment:
   - Clear opposing liquidity pool
   - Minimum 1:3 risk-reward ratio
   - No intervening liquidity between entry-TP
   - Volume profile confirmation

ENTRY TRIGGERS:
----------------------
1. Primary Entry:
   - Retest of inverse FVG zone
   - Price reaction at 50% retracement
   - Confluence with HTF pivot level
   - Volume threshold met at entry
   - Multiple timeframe confirmation
   - Maximum 6 candles for trigger

2. Secondary Entry:
   - Break of swing high/low post-FVG
   - Close beyond dynamic ATR from trigger
   - Volume confirmation on breakout
   - Lower timeframe momentum aligned
   - Clean price action (no opposing wicks)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
----------------------
- Stop Loss: 
   * Beyond liquidity sweep extreme + (1.8Ã—ATR for high volatility)
   * Dynamic adjustment based on volatility

- Take Profit:
   * Full: Opposing liquidity zone

- RR Ratio: Minimum 1:3 (measured entry-SL vs entry-TP)

CONFIRMATION FILTERS:
----------------------
1. Reject if:
   - No clear HTF liquidity target
   - FVG forms before liquidity sweep
   - Structural change lacks volume confirmation
   - Price consolidates >3 candles post-trigger
   - Volume decreases over 3+ consecutive candles
   - Structural break isn't confirmed with volume
   - ATR > 3.5% of current price (volatility filter)
   - Against major support/resistance levels
   - Higher timeframe trend misalignment

2. Accept only:
   - Multiple timeframe trend alignment
   - Momentum aligns with trade direction
   - Clean sweep of liquidity
   - Volume progression is healthy
   - No HTF resistance/support between entry-TP
   - Volatility within acceptable range
   - VWAP alignment with trade direction

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
-----------------------
- Output price levels as numbers only (e.g. 61250.50)
