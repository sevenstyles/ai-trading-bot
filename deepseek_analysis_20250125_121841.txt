5. Risk Management Plan
-----------------------
- Position Size: â‰¤2% capital at entry zone
- Dynamic SL: Move to breakeven at TP1 hit
- Contingency: 
  - Cancel setup if 1H closes above $106,500 with volume <5k BTC
  - Add short position at $104,800 breakdown with SL $105,300
- Max Drawdown: 1.5% per trade cycle
``` 

**Rationale:** The setup capitalizes on the failed breakout above $107k and subsequent liquidity grab. The FVG between $105,650-$106,320 acts as a premium zone for institutional selling, with TP targets aligning with historical liquidity pools. Bearish volume profile and RSI divergence confirm weakening bullish momentum.
