Institutional Order Flow Trading Framework
======================================================

CORE ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Auction Market Structure:
   - HTF (Daily) Market Phase (Impulse/Retracement/Consolidation)
   - MTF (4H) Fair Value Gap Identification
   - LTF (1H) Structural Breaks (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Recent Liquidity Sweeps (Stop Hunts/Equal Highs-Lows)
   - Market Phase Detection:
     * Impulse: 3+ consecutive FVGs with >1.5% daily range
     * Retracement: 50-78.6% Fibonacci of Daily impulse
     * Consolidation: <0.5% daily range for 3 sessions

2. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Institutional Inducement Patterns (Sweep->Run->Retest)
   - Stop Cluster Density Mapping (Recent 3 swing points)
   - Volume-Weighted Liquidity Pools
   - V-Shaped Reversals Post-Liquidation Events

3. ORDER FLOW FOOTPRINTS:
   - LARGE IMBALANCE CANDLES (2x AVERAGE RANGE)
   - ABSORPTION PATTERNS AT KEY LEVELS
   - VOLUME DELTA ANALYSIS (HIDDEN VS VISIBLE ACTIVITY)
   - DELTA DIVERGENCE ON RETESTS

4. LTF Analysis:
   - Intraday Liquidity Pools (Recent 4-6 hours)
   - Immediate Price Acceptance/Rejection
   - Short-Term Order Flow Imbalances
   - Market Maker Model Patterns (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Retail Trader Cluster Zones

HIGH PROBABILITY SETUP CRITERIA:
---------------------------
1. Consider Conditions:
   - HTF/MTF/LTF Tri-Timeframe Confluence
   - Recent Liquidity Sweep within 3% of current price
   - Volume Spike (150%+ of 20-period average)
   - Clear Institutional Footprint (Pinning Bar/FVG/OB)
   - Unmitigated Order Blocks (<3 touches)
   - Volume Profile POC within 0.3% of entry zone

2. Entry Execution Rules:
   - Limit Orders Only (No Market Entries)
   - Entry Trigger: Retest of Swept Liquidity Zone + MTF OB/OS
   - Confirm with LTF Break of Structure (BOS) or Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Require 2nd Test of Key Level After Initial Sweep
   - Validate with 1H Volume Surge

3. Risk Management Protocol:
   - Stop Loss: [based on analysis]
   - Profit Taking: Minimum 1:3 RR Ratio
