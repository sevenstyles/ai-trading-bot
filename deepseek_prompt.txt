======================================================

Core Analysis Components:
----------------------
1. Auction Market Structure:
   - HTF (Daily) Market Phase (Impulse/Retracement/Consolidation)
   - MTF (4H) Fair Value Gap Identification
   - LTF (1H) Structural Breaks (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Recent Liquidity Sweeps (Stop Hunts/Equal Highs-Lows)
   - Market Phase Detection:
     * Impulse: 3+ consecutive FVGs with >1.5% daily range
     * Retracement: 50-78.6% Fibonacci of Daily impulse
     * Consolidation: <0.5% daily range for 3 sessions

2. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Institutional Inducement Patterns (Sweep->Run->Retest)
   - Stop Cluster Density Mapping (Recent 3 swing points)
   - Volume-Weighted Liquidity Pools
   - V-Shaped Reversals Post-Liquidation Events

3. Order Flow Footprints:
   - Large Imbalance Candles (2x average range)
   - Absorption Patterns at Key Levels
   - Volume Delta Analysis (Hidden vs Visible Activity)
   - Delta Divergence on Retests

4. LTF Analysis:
   - Intraday Liquidity Pools (Recent 4-6 hours)
   - Immediate Price Acceptance/Rejection
   - Short-Term Order Flow Imbalances
   - Market Maker Model Patterns (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Retail Trader Cluster Zones

High Probability Setup Criteria:
---------------------------
1. Consider Conditions:

   - Clear Institutional Footprint (Pinning Bar/FVG/OB)
   - Unmitigated Order Blocks (<3 touches)
   - Volume Profile POC within 0.3% of entry zone

2. Entry Execution Rules:
   - Limit Orders Only (No Market Entries)
   - Entry Trigger: Retest of Swept Liquidity Zone + MTF OB/OS
   - Confirm with LTF Break of Structure (BOS) or Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Require 2nd Test of Key Level After Initial Sweep
   - Validate with 1H Volume Surge

3. Risk Management Protocol:
   - Stop Loss: [based on analysis]
   - Profit Taking: Minimum 1:3 RR Ratio

Example Response Framework:
---------------------------
- HTF Phase: Bullish Impulse (Daily) 
- MTF Structure: 4H FVG @ $[price]
- LTF Confirmation: 1H BOS above $[price]
- Volume Profile: POC @ $[price] (4H FVG Base)  
- Delta Flow: 2:1 Buyer Dominance
- Confidence score: [reasoning]

Trade Setup:
