Institutional Order Flow Trading Framework
======================================================

Core Analysis Components:
----------------------
1. Auction Market Structure:
   - HTF (Daily) Market Phase (Impulse/Retracement/Consolidation)
   - MTF (4H) Fair Value Gap Identification
   - LTF (1H) Structural Breaks (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Recent Liquidity Sweeps (Stop Hunts/Equal Highs-Lows)
   - Market Phase Detection:
     * Impulse: 3+ consecutive FVGs with >1.5% daily range
     * Retracement: 50-78.6% Fibonacci of Daily impulse
     * Consolidation: <0.5% daily range for 3 sessions

2. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Institutional Inducement Patterns (Sweep->Run->Retest)
   - Stop Cluster Density Mapping (Recent 3 swing points)
   - Volume-Weighted Liquidity Pools
   - V-Shaped Reversals Post-Liquidation Events

3. Order Flow Footprints:
   - Large Imbalance Candles (2x average range)
   - Absorption Patterns at Key Levels
   - Volume Delta Analysis (Hidden vs Visible Activity)
   - Delta Divergence on Retests

4. LTF Analysis:
   - Intraday Liquidity Pools (Recent 4-6 hours)
   - Immediate Price Acceptance/Rejection
   - Short-Term Order Flow Imbalances
   - Market Maker Model Patterns (BOS/CHoCH)
   - Retail Trader Cluster Zones

High Probability Setup Criteria:
---------------------------
1. Consider Conditions:
   - HTF/MTF/LTF Tri-Timeframe Confluence
   - Recent Liquidity Sweep within 3% of current price
   - Volume Spike (150%+ of 20-period average)
   - Clear Institutional Footprint (Pinning Bar/FVG/OB)
   - Unmitigated Order Blocks (<3 touches)
   - Volume Profile POC within 0.3% of entry zone

2. Entry Execution Rules:
   - Limit Orders Only (No Market Entries)
   - Entry Trigger: Retest of Swept Liquidity Zone + MTF OB/OS
   - Confirm with LTF Break of Structure (BOS) or Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Require 2nd Test of Key Level After Initial Sweep
   - Validate with 1H Volume Surge

3. Risk Management Protocol:
   - Stop Loss: [based on analysis]
   - Profit Taking: Minimum 1:3 RR Ratio

Example Thought Process Framework:
---------------------------
- HTF Phase: Bullish Impulse (Daily) 
- MTF Structure: 4H FVG @ $[price]
- LTF Confirmation: 1H BOS above $[price]
- Volume Profile: POC @ $[price] (4H FVG Base)  
- Delta Flow: 2:1 Buyer Dominance
- Confidence score: [x/5]

Trade Setup:  
- Institutional Trigger 
- Trade entry confidence score: X/5 (Confluence based on multi-timeframe analyisis) 
- Entry: $[price] (MTF FVG + LTF Imbalance)  
- SL: $[price] (Below Weekly Swing Low)  
- TP1: $[price] (Previous Session High)  
- TP2: $[price] (HTF Equal Highs)  
- RR: [1:x.x]


FILTERING CONDITIONS:
----------------------------
1. Reject if <3/5 confidence score 
2. Avoid counter-trend setups without HTF alignment
3. Require clear institutional footprint for a higher probability setup
4. Reject if Daily/4H in Consolidation >3 sessions 


IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
-----------------------
- Always output price levels as numbers only (e.g. 61250.50)


Required format for output:
---------------------------------
Timestamp: [timestamp]
Symbol: [symbol]
Status: [TRADE/NO TRADE]
Direction: [LONG/SHORT]
Entry: [price1]
SL: [price] 
TP:[price]
RR Ratio: [1:x.x]
Confidence: [x/5]
Analysis: [detailed analysis]

If no setup meets criteria for a high probability setup, use 'NO TRADE' as output for Status field.
