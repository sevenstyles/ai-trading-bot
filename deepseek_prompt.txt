2. Liquidity Analysis:
   - Institutional Inducement Patterns (Sweep->Run->Retest)
   - Stop Cluster Density Mapping (Recent 3 swing points)
   - Volume-Weighted Liquidity Pools
   - V-Shaped Reversals Post-Liquidation Events

3. Order Flow Footprints:
   - Large Imbalance Candles (2x average range)
   - Absorption Patterns at Key Levels
   - Volume Delta Analysis (Hidden vs Visible Activity)

4. LTF Analysis:
   - Intraday Liquidity Pools (Recent 4-6 hours)
   - Immediate Price Acceptance/Rejection
