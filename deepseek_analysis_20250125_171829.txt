========================================

**NO TRADE** ⚪️ (Market in Balance)

**Rationale:**  
- *Volume Filter Triggered*: Current daily volume (2855.32 BTC) < 80% of recent average (~20k+ BTC)  
- *HTF Structure*: Choppy price action between $104k-$107k after failed breakout attempt  
- *Liquidity Profile*: Recent sweep of $104.2k lows lacked sufficient follow-through volume  
- *Order Flow*: No clear absorption/vol delta signals in critical zones  

*No Edge: Market in Balance*
