Forever Model Trading Framework
======================================================

Analyse the OHLC & volume data to determine if a trade setup is ready to be entered:

CORE COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation:
   - Must occur BEFORE inverse FVG formation
   - Multiple sweeps in same direction add confluence
   - Must show clean sweep with weak closing price

2. Inverse Fair Value Gap (FVG):
   - Forms AFTER confirmed liquidity sweep
   - Maximum age: 48 hours from formation
   - Multiple aligned FVGs add confluence
   - Must be validated by ATR penetration

3. Structural Change Confirmation:
   - Must show clear Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Break of Structure (BOS) with volume confirmation


4. Smart Money Trap (SMT) [Optional A++]:
   - Clear price rejection
   - Must align with HTF order block
   - Volume-weighted rejection pattern
   - Presence upgrades setup to A++ rating

5. Opposing Liquidity Target:
   - Minimum 3 equal highs/lows
   - Must form over minimum 12 candles
   - Decreasing volume profile required
   - Must meet 1:3 risk-reward minimum
   - Requires cluster of 3+ liquidity markers
   - No significant interference levels between entry and target

ENTRY RULES:
---------------------------

Primary Entry Method:

1. Exact Entry Triggers:

   - Retest of inverse FVG zone
   - HTF pivot level confluence
   - Timeframe alignment:

   a) Primary: 4-hour chart
   b) Secondary: 15-minute chart


2. Entry Types:

   - Limit Orders:

   a) Shorts: Upper bound of FVG
   b) Longs: Lower bound of FVG

   - Market Orders:

   a) Only after explicit confirmation candle
   b) Must have clean price action (no opposing wicks)

Primary Entry Method (Breakout):

   - Break of swing high/low after FVG formation
   - Must close beyond dynamic ATR
   - Requires volume confirmation
   - Must meet all primary entry criteria
   - Lower timeframe momentum alignment required


RISK MANAGEMENT:
----------------------
Stop Loss Placement: 

   - Beyond liquidity sweep extreme
   - Additional buffer: 1.8Ã— ATR
   - Maximum stop size: 2.5x current ATR
   - Reject trade if stop exceeds maximum size

Take Profit Rules:

   - Target: Opposing liquidity zone
   - Must meet minimum 1:3 risk-reward
   - No significant interference levels between entry and target


MANDATORY REJECTION CRITERIA:
----------------------
Reject Trade If:

1. Structure-related:

   - FVG forms before liquidity sweep
   - No clear HTF liquidity target
   - Against major support/resistance
   - HTF trend misalignment


2. Technical-related:

   - ATR exceeds 3.5% of current price
   - Stop loss exceeds 2.5x current ATR
   - Lower timeframe (15m) misalignment

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
-----------------------
- Output price levels as numbers only (e.g. 61250.50)
