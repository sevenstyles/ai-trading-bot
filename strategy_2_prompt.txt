Forever Model Trading Framework
======================================================

Analyse the OHLC & volume data to determine if a trade setup is ready to be entered:

CORE COMPONENTS:
----------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation:
   - Clear buy/sell side liquidity sweep
   - Must occur before inverse FVG formation
   - Volume spike validation (2.5-3x average for high volatility assets)
   - Maximum sweep formation time (3 candles)
   - Multiple sweep validation adds strength
   - Reject if sweep volume exceeds 5x average (potential manipulation)

2. Inverse Fair Value Gap (FVG):
   - Must form AFTER liquidity sweep
   - Displacement through inefficiency zone
   - Minimum size 1.2% of current price
   - Maximum age 48 hours
   - Multiple FVG confluence adds strength
   - Validate with dynamic ATR penetration
   - Must have minimum 8-12 candle consolidation before FVG at new highs/lows

3. Structural Change Confirmation:
   - Change of Character (CHoCH)
   - Break of Structure (BOS)
   - Volume-weighted price levels
   - Maximum 12 candles for validation
   - RSI threshold >65 for bullish, <35 for bearish
   - Volume progression during formation
   - Must show bullish/bearish divergence on RSI
   - MACD histogram must show increasing momentum for 3+ candles

4. Smart Money Trap (SMT) [Optional A++]:
   - Price rejection at key level (2.5-3% wick)
   - Volume-weighted rejection pattern
   - Multiple timeframe trap alignment
   - Confluence with HTF order block
   - Volume distribution analysis during trap

5. Opposing Liquidity Target:
   - Minimum 3 equal highs/lows within 0.5% range
   - Must form over at least 12 candles
   - Must have decreasing volume profile
   - Internal pool within 1:3 RR ratio
   - Validate with cluster of 3+ liquidity markers
   - Volume-weighted price levels

SETUP CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED):
---------------------------
1. Liquidity Sweep Sequence:
   - HTF liquidity pool identification
   - Sweep of recent high/low with weak close
   - Subsequent pullback into manipulation zone
   - Progressive volume increase
   - Multiple timeframe alignment
   - Volume cannot exceed 5x average on sweep

2. Inverse FVG Formation:
   - Must displace through inefficiency
   - Formed in direction of intended trade
   - Unmitigated FVG from previous move
   - Minimum size requirement met
   - Age requirement met
   - Requires consolidation period before FVG at new highs/lows

3. Structural Change:
   - Volume-weighted price levels broken
   - Momentum confirmation (MACD/RSI thresholds)
   - Volume increase on structural break (>1.8x but <5x)
   - Time-based validation window
   - Multiple timeframe alignment
   - RSI divergence confirmation
   - Progressive MACD histogram increase

4. Liquidity Alignment:
   - Clear opposing liquidity pool
   - Minimum 1:3 risk-reward ratio
   - No intervening liquidity between entry-TP
   - Volume profile confirmation
   - Must meet enhanced liquidity pool quality criteria

ENTRY TRIGGERS:
----------------------
1. Primary Entry:
   - Retest of inverse FVG zone
   - Price reaction at 50% retracement
   - Confluence with HTF pivot level
   - Volume threshold met at entry (1.8-5x average)
   - Multiple timeframe confirmation
   - Maximum 6 candles for trigger
   - Minimum 3 aligned 15m candles before 4H entry
   - Higher volume thresholds during Asian sessions
   - Entry Method: Limit order at FVG zone OR Market order on confirmation
   - Limit Order Placement: At upper bound of FVG for shorts, lower bound for longs

2. Secondary Entry:
   - Break of swing high/low post-FVG
   - Close beyond dynamic ATR from trigger
   - Volume confirmation on breakout
   - Lower timeframe momentum aligned
   - Clean price action (no opposing wicks)
   - Must meet all primary entry criteria

RISK MANAGEMENT:
----------------------
- Stop Loss: 
   * Beyond liquidity sweep extreme + (1.8Ã—ATR for high volatility)
   * Dynamic adjustment based on volatility
   * Maximum stop size: 2.5x current ATR
   * Reject trade if required stop exceeds maximum

- Take Profit:
   * Full: Opposing liquidity zone
   * Must have quality liquidity pool criteria met

- RR Ratio: Minimum 1:3 or higher if good trade setup (measured entry-SL vs entry-TP)


CONFIRMATION FILTERS:
----------------------
1. Reject if:
   - No clear HTF liquidity target
   - FVG forms before liquidity sweep
   - Structural change lacks volume confirmation
   - Price consolidates >3 candles post-trigger
   - Volume decreases over 3+ consecutive candles
   - Structural break isn't confirmed with volume
   - ATR > 3.5% of current price (volatility filter)
   - Against major support/resistance levels
   - Higher timeframe trend misalignment
   - Volume spike exceeds 5x average
   - Stop loss exceeds 2.5x current ATR
   - No minimum consolidation period at new highs/lows
   - Entry during low liquidity periods without volume confirmation
   - Liquidity pool quality criteria not met
   - No RSI divergence confirmation
   - MACD histogram not showing progressive increase
   - Lower timeframe (15m) misalignment

2. Accept only:
   - Multiple timeframe trend alignment (4H and 15m minimum)
   - Momentum aligns with trade direction
   - Clean sweep of liquidity
   - Volume progression is healthy (1.8-5x average)
   - No HTF resistance/support between entry-TP
   - Volatility within acceptable range
   - VWAP alignment with trade direction
   - Quality liquidity pool formation
   - Clear RSI divergence
   - Progressive MACD histogram
   - Minimum 3 aligned 15m candles
   - Proper consolidation period at new highs/lows
